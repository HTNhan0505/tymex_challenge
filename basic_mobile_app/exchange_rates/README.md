## Overview :
This application is used for currency conversion. I have utilized the API from [ExchangeRatesApi](https://exchangeratesapi.io/) which allows only 100 requests per month. For the Android application, when the user inputs data, the system will automatically update the values and then store the currency exchange rates for different countries in the deviceâ€™s memory to handle cases of internet loss. For the iOS application, there will be a feature to check for empty fields that do not have values.

## Steps to build and run it :
To run this project, simply clone it and click the 'run' button in Android Studio or Xcode.

## Notes :
You can turn the internet on or off to check if the application stores data in the device's memory.

## I have built all the APK files for the test cases to make it convenient for you to test the application.
